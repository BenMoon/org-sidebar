* org-sidebar

This package presents a helpful sidebar view for Org buffers.  Sidebars are customizable using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-ql][org-ql]] queries and [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda][org-super-agenda]] grouping.

The default view includes a chronological list of scheduled and deadlined tasks in the current buffer (similar to the Org agenda ,but without all its features) at the top, and a list of all other non-done to-do items below.  If the buffer is narrowed, the sidebar only shows items in the narrowed portion; this allows seeing an overview of tasks in a subtree.

** Usage
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      0
:END:

Run command =org-sidebar= to display the default sidebars for the current Org buffer.  Customization options are in the =org-sidebar= group.

To display your own sidebars, call the function =org-sidebar= with the arguments described in its docstring.  Also see the functions =org-sidebar--upcoming-items= and =org-sidebar--todo-items= for examples.

*** Key bindings

In a sidebar buffer, these keys are bound:

+  =RET=, =mouse-1= :: Jump to an item in its buffer.
+  =g= :: Update the sidebar.
+  =q= :: Hide the sidebar.

*** Commands

+  ~org-sidebar~ :: ~(&key BUFFERS FNS STRUCTS GROUP SUPER-GROUPS)~ Display the Org Sidebar.
   
   Interactively, display the sidebars configured in ~org-sidebar-default-fns~.
   
   ~BUFFERS~ may be one or a list of buffers to display in the sidebar.
   
   ~FNS~ may be one or a list of functions, each of which may return a buffer or a ~org-sidebar~ struct.

   ~SIDEBARS~ may be one or a list of ~org-sidebar~ structs.
   
   When ~GROUP~ is non-nil (interactively, with one universal prefix argument), and when ~SUPER-GROUPS~ is nil, call each function with the ~group~ keyword argument non-nil.
   
   ~SUPER-GROUPS~ may be a list of groups according to ~org-super-agenda-groups~, in which case the items in the buffers will be grouped accordingly (where applicable).  Interactively, with two universal prefix arguments, the global value of ~org-super-agenda-groups~ is used.
+  ~org-sidebar-ql~ :: ~(&key QUERY BUFFERS-FILES NARROW GROUP-PROPERTY SORT)~ Display a sidebar for ~org-ql~ ~QUERY~.  Interactively, with prefix, prompt for these variables:
   
   ~BUFFERS-FILES~: ~A~ list of buffers and/or files to search.
   
   ~NARROW~: When non-nil, donâ€™t widen buffers before searching.
   
   ~GROUP-PROPERTY~: One of the following symbols: ~category~, ~parent~, ~priority~, ~todo~.
   
   ~SORT~: One or a list of ~org-ql~ sorting functions, like ~date~ or ~priority~.
+  ~org-sidebar-update~ :: Update current sidebar buffer.
