* org-sidebar

This package presents a helpful sidebar view for Org buffers.  At the top is a chronological list of scheduled and deadlined tasks in the current buffer (similar to the Org agenda ,but without all its features), and below that is a list of all other non-done to-do items.  If the buffer is narrowed, the sidebar only shows items in the narrowed portion; this allows seeing an overview of tasks in a subtree.

Please note: this package is in an early stage of development, so incompatible changes may be made in the future.  However, it's stable and usable now.  Feedback is appreciated.
