** Custom sidebar command

It's easy to define a custom sidebar command.  Here's an example that shows items in =org-agenda-files= that are not done and either have a deadline on or before today, or are scheduled for today.  They are sorted by date, then to-do keyword, then priority, and they are grouped with =org-super-agenda= into 4 groups:

+  Time-grid items
+  Items tagged =bills=
+  Priority =A= items
+  Items that are not to-do items (e.g. only have a date associated)
+  Finally, leftover items that have priority less than =B= are discarded.

Note that items returned by the ~org-ql~ query are mapped through the ~ap/org-sidebar-format-element~ function, which calls the default formatting function, ~org-agenda-ng--format-element~, and then modifies the face of the items to inherit from the =variable-pitch= face.  Of course, this is optional, but shows how results can be customized.

Note also that ~org-ql~ is called with the ~:markers t~ argument, which causes it to add the appropriate markers to entries so ~org-sidebar~ can jump to them when activated.  

Future changes may streamline the process of making custom commands.  Feedback is welcome.

This shows a sidebar like this:
